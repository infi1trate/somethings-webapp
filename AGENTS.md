# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

## Responsive work

Before touching any layout, read `docs/responsive/01-CONTEXT.md` — it carries the
standard, the breakpoint situation, and the six known root causes. Hold
`docs/responsive/03-DEFINITION-OF-DONE.md` as the bar for any view you change.
`docs/responsive/02-VIEW-MATRIX.md` is the view inventory;
`docs/responsive/TRACKER.md` is the live status once it exists. Generated audit
artifacts go in `docs/responsive/`.

All three source docs live in `docs/responsive/` alongside the generated
artifacts, so a phase file citing `docs/responsive/01-CONTEXT.md` resolves
directly — there is no path mapping to apply.

The audit in `01-CONTEXT.md` was taken against `main` @ `08c91d1`. Line citations
drift as the code moves; verify one before acting on it, and correct the doc when
it has moved rather than working from the stale number.
